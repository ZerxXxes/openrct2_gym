## Architecture Overview

This is a Gymnasium environment for training RL agents to build roller coasters in OpenRCT2. The project has evolved from UI automation to API-based control.

### Core Components

**openrct2_gym/envs/openrct2_env.py**: Main Gymnasium environment that manages the RL training loop. Key features:
- Discrete action space (32 actions: 30 track pieces + remove action)
- Complex observation space tracking position, direction, track pieces, and distance to goal
- Auto-backtracking mechanism for handling consecutive placement failures
- Physics-aware energy estimation (chain lifts add energy, drops convert to speed)
- Pattern detection (lift hills, drops, turnarounds)
- Soft approach guidance for station connection

**openrct2_gym/envs/api_controller.py**: Handles communication with OpenRCT2 game via HTTP API
- Connects to OpenRCT2 plugin server (default port 8080)
- Manages track placement, removal, and circuit completion
- Retrieves ride statistics for reward calculation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability

**openrct2_gym/envs/improved_phased_curriculum_wrapper.py**: 5-phase curriculum learning
- Phase 1: Return Practice (40 pieces) - Learn navigation
- Phase 2: Lift Hill Building (40 pieces) - Learn chain lifts and energy (staged 2.1/2.2/2.3)
- Phase 3: Real Drops & Scale (60 pieces) - chain height >=4z, drops >=4z, length >=25,
  energy-viable at completion (graded structure credit, not piece counting)
- Phase 4: Big & Verified (80 pieces) - height >=6z, drops >=8z incl. a 60-degree segment,
  length >=40; ride testing ON, R_viable=150 paid only when the test returns real stats
- **P3/P4 length-trap fix (Jul-6)**: the Jul-5 overnight run converged onto an 18-piece
  mini-loop in P3 (additive length credit paid ~+2/piece vs ~-10/piece gamma-discount of the
  completion payout; qualified_rate decayed 0.14 -> 0, entropy saturated). Two coupled terms,
  both diagnosed in TB: `completion_length_floor=0.25` multiplies the completion gate by a
  length ramp toward `struct_length_target` (~+30/piece; `rewards/completion_gate`), and
  `R_qualify=200` pays the phase's qualified-gate predicate as a discrete completion bonus
  (P3: struct targets + energy proxy; P4: + steep drop + verified test; `rewards/qualify_bonus`)
- **P4 steep credit (Jul-7)**: the qualified gate's 60-degree leg was reward-invisible outside
  the R_qualify conjunction — 9h of verified-P4 training placed zero steep pieces while entropy
  sat at the collapse line. `struct_w_steep=0.2` grades steep-dropped z (actions 8/27/28) toward
  `struct_steep_target=8` (one 25->60->25 segment); P4 height/drop reweighted 0.4->0.3 so a
  no-steep build caps at 0.8 of struct+gate. Steep premium on a verified 40-piece loop: +450
  (gate release + struct + qualify). Watch `structure/steep_drop_z`. RULE: every leg of a
  phase's qualified gate needs its own ramp in the reward — conjunction-only legs don't get
  discovered once entropy tightens
- **P4 steep scaffold (Jul-8)**: the credit alone still wasn't discovered (12h, zero
  self-placed steep pieces — steep prefixes appeared only at their ~7% pool share via short
  Phase-2-era seeds). The warm pool is now steep-aware: `LoopRecord.steep_drop_z` (derived
  property, no schema migration), P4 pool criteria = the gate itself (`min_len=40,
  min_steep_z=8`, any-steep fallback tier so the scaffold never turns off), plus
  `build_loop_library.py --p4` seeding 40-44 piece verified steep loops
  (`generate_p4_candidates`; 24 seeded live Jul-8). RULE: a rare gate skill needs
  scaffold-side practice (reverse curriculum), not just reward-side visibility
- Phase 6: Style / Variety (120 pieces) - added Jul-14: the monoculture fix. Every earlier
  phase converged onto ONE rectangle motif because nothing paid for shape. P6 grades turn
  count (.25@12), S-bends (.05@4), and handedness BALANCE (.10@2 -- min(left,right) turn
  pieces; a rectangle is all-one-direction so this leg forces genuine winding), keeps the
  P5 quality economics (exc gate 0.4->E6, milestones, caps, R_viable), and gates qualified
  on tested E>=4.5 AND turns>=12 AND balance>=2. Entry from P5: length ladder done + cold
  tested-E>=4 rate >= 0.30 (phase6_entry_threshold). Scaffolds stay ON in P6 with
  min_turns=8 pool criterion and a per-shape-bin cap (P6_BIN_CAP=3) so one style cannot
  monopolize the pool; `generate_p6_candidates` seeds winding exemplars (canceling
  jog-pairs = both handedness, net-zero lateral; seed with
  `seed_p5_exemplars.py --family p6`). Watch structure/turn_balance + structure/sbend_count
- **P5 quality unlock (Jul-9)**: P4 solved, then P5 plateaued at E=1.15 on a 24-piece loop
  (ungated completion, third occurrence of the trap). Root cause verified in the game
  source: FIVE wooden-RC rating caps each HALVE all ratings when missed (single drop >=12z,
  >=2 drops, speed >=~22mph, a negative-G moment, ~370m measured length) — the mini-loop
  missed 4-5 (÷16-32 ≈ the observed 1.15). Redesign, all diagnosed in TB:
  (a) completion quality gate: `completion_quality_floor=0.4` paid at close, remainder
  ramps with MEASURED excitement to `exc_gate_target=6` (paid post-test, same terminal
  step ⇒ exactly multiplicative); (b) P5 struct credit re-aimed at the caps
  (`struct_w_single_drop/.30@12z, drop_runs/.20@2, drop/.15@16, length/.20@70, banked/.15@4`
  — length target CALIBRATED Jul-10: probe_measurements measured 5.5 m/piece live, so the
  ~370m cap sits near ~67 pieces; the probe also confirmed the cap model, a 4-caps-failing
  44-piece loop rating E 0.30 ≈ base/16);
  (c) `R_exc_milestone=100 @ (2.5,4.0,5.5)` bars + kept `R_viable=150`;
  (d) `R_caps_max=250` graded on REAL measurements via the plugin's new
  `getRideMeasurements` (v0.3; degrades to 0 on an old plugin); (e) `w_exc_feat=6` dense
  per-piece Phi over static excitement features (turns/banked/drop-runs/single-drop/length);
  (f) **P5 warm-start scaffolding** with excitement-tagged records (harvest moved
  POST-test; `LoopRecord.excitement`; upgrade-append dedup keeps the best-rated variant)
  and a self-ratcheting pool bar (`0.8 × best_excitement(budget)`, any-excited fallback
  tier). Harvest cap now follows the phase budget (fixes the silent P4 >40-piece harvest
  hole). Calibrate/validate with `probe_measurements.py` (m/piece + per-cap verdicts;
  the mini-loop should reproduce E≈1.15 with 4-5 caps failing)
- Phase 5: Quality Optimization (80-120 pieces) - ramp+band quality bonus (every increment
  toward E8/I5.5 pays), no step cost, P5 exploration floor while median excitement < 4;
  since Jul-9 also: excitement-gated completion, cap-aligned struct credit, milestone bars,
  measured-caps bonus, excitement-feature Phi, and self-imitation scaffolding (see the
  P5 quality unlock bullet below)

**openrct2_gym/envs/api_track_builder.py**: Manages track construction logic
- Translates discrete actions to API calls
- Maintains track history for backtracking
- Handles position and direction updates based on track piece geometry

**openrct2_gym/envs/action_masking.py**: Implements action filtering to prevent invalid moves
- SimpleActionMasker: Basic rule-based action filtering
- SmartActionSampler: Intelligent action sampling based on current state

### Training Scripts

- **train.py**: The single consolidated training script (the legacy `train_parallel_curriculum_masked.py`
  and `train_rl_agent_*.py` were merged into it). Always uses the 5-phase physics-aware curriculum with
  the unified potential-based reward and MaskablePPO action masking.
  - `--ports` (comma-separated): one OpenRCT2 instance per port; `SubprocVecEnv` for 2+ ports, else `DummyVecEnv`
  - other flags: `--timesteps`, `--disable-eval`, `--model-path` (resume), `--target-rollout`, `--checkpoint-freq`, `--eval-freq`
  - warm-start flags: `--no-warm-start` (disable the reverse curriculum), `--loop-library PATH`
    (default `logs/loop_library.jsonl`), `--p-cold F` (base cold-episode fraction, default 0.25)
- **build_loop_library.py**: seeds the warm-start loop library with live-verified closable loops
  (run once per map: `python build_loop_library.py --port 8080` and `--hill` for the Phase-2 pool).
- **run_model.py**: Run a trained model.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **API Integration**: The environment uses OpenRCT2's scripting API with:
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (0.5s, 1s, 2s)
   - Proper resource cleanup (no file descriptor leaks)
   - DummyVecEnv for stable parallel training (no subprocess sync issues)

2. **Physics-Aware Reward Structure** (always on; potential-based / PBRS):
   - Energy estimation: chain lifts add energy, drops convert to speed
   - Pattern detection: rewards for lift hills, drops, turnarounds
   - Soft approach guidance: bonuses for correct height/direction near station
   - **Goal = the STAGING tile [62,66,14] (one tile east of the dock); deterministic, dock-coupled
     closing heading**: the head can never sit ON the dock tile (occupied by BeginStation), so
     `goal_position` is the staging tile the closing piece is placed FROM (openrct2_env.py reset();
     probe_corridor.py confirmed 7+ pieces dock from there; a goal-=-dock experiment collapsed
     completion to 0% and was reverted). The station is built with `startDir=0` (dir 0 = West,
     vector (-1,0)), so every circuit re-enters BeginStation heading dir 0; Φ is handed this closing
     heading (`_STATION_ENTRY_DIR`) from step 1, and the heading reward is **coupled to the dock**
     (gated by the near-closure factor) so the agent is free to turn while routing and only must align
     as it docks. The full closing geometry is still refined from real completions (anchor locked
     only after ≥3 agree).
   - **Route potential (`w_route`, on in phases 1-4)**: the directional approach cone is deliberately
     zero on the whole start/west side, which left the detour around the station unshaped (the Jun-24
     run parked ~5 tiles out forever). `_route_progress()` pays bounded angular progress of the head's
     bearing around the station center — monotone along BOTH detours, PBRS-clean, diagnosed via
     `rewards/route_potential`.
   - **Phase-2 hill-discovery bootstrap**: the climb-and-return milestone is made *discoverable* by
     annealing `roundtrip_gain` (1→1→3 z across sub-stages 2.1/2.2/2.3; the bar is CHAIN-banked gain —
     the canonical hill [10,9,13] banks 3, its crest piece isn't chained) plus a small one-time summit
     breadcrumb (`R_summit` 40→30→0), with a raised early-Phase-2 entropy floor
     (`PHASE2_EARLY_ENT_COEF=0.018` in `train.py`) so exploration survives long enough to find the climb.
     The completion hill gate scales chain credit by chain-banked ELEVATION against that bar, so
     chain-stub decoration on a flat loop cannot pay as a full hill.
   - Ride quality optimization in Phase 5 (Excitement 7-9, Intensity 4.5-6.5, Nausea <4.5)

3. **5-Phase Curriculum Learning**:
   - Phases focus on specific skills before combining them
   - Trusts API's `isCircuitComplete` flag (no artificial restrictions)
   - Progressive track length limits (40 → 40 → 60 → 80 → 120; Phase 1 raised 25→40 to give the agent
     room to route a loop back to the station before truncation)
   - **Warm-start reverse curriculum (phases 1-2)**: completion is a discovery problem (a minimal
     loop is 12 exact pieces; the Jun-24 run saw 7 completions in 31k episodes and entropy-collapsed).
     At reset the env replays a prefix of a verified loop from `logs/loop_library.jsonl`
     (`openrct2_gym/envs/warm_start.py`: `LoopLibrary` + per-worker `WarmStartAnnealer`); the agent
     builds the last k pieces, k anneals up on frontier success, and every completion is harvested
     back into the library. **Phase gates count cold (unscaffolded) episodes only** — read
     `success/cold_completion_rate` and `curriculum/warm_k_max` in TB, not the scaffold-mixed
     `overall_loop_completion_rate`. A progress-conditional entropy floor (`optim/ent_floor_mode`)
     holds ent_coef at 0.025 with a raised collapse band until cold completions flow (≥2%), then
     restores the proven 0.01 config.

4. **Action Space**: 32 discrete actions (30 track pieces + remove + flat), with action masking to prevent invalid placements
   - **Descending pieces are placed at BASE z** (`api_track_builder.py descent_entry_z_offset`,
     live-probed): the plugin validates a piece's train ENTRY against the previous end but takes the
     base z, which for descents sits below the entry by the piece's drop (25°=2, 60°=8, flat↔25=1,
     25↔60=4). Before this offset every descent placement failed silently — drops were effectively
     removed from the action space in all earlier runs.

### Measurement rules (Aug-2026 variety campaign — five metrics lied before these existed)

The project's signature failure is a metric that measures something other than its name. It
has now happened five times. These rules are the distilled cost:

1. **Split every quality/structure metric by warm vs cold.** A *warm* (scaffolded) episode
   replays a prefix of a library exemplar, so its rating and its shape are the exemplar's,
   not the policy's. `quality/median_excitement` pooled both and read ~5.5 while the agent's
   own rides rated **2.4** — and v1's headline "median excitement 5.58" was conflated the
   same way (its archive README carries a correction). Cold-only variants now exist
   (`quality/median_excitement_cold`, `structure/family_hit_cold`); prefer them for any
   claim, and always emit the sample count beside a median.
2. **A conflated metric can drive training, not just reporting.** That same pooled median
   gated the P5 exploration floor, so exploration was withdrawn on the *scaffold's* quality
   while the policy's own rides were still at 2.4.
3. **A metric only WRITTEN in some states must only be READ in those states.**
   `family_gate`/`family_match` are set on completion and reset to 0.0 otherwise, so a plain
   mean reports `completion_rate x value`. Same trap for a phase-scoped tag read in a later
   phase (`phase2_threshold` looks like a live gate at P3+).
4. **The library is not a neutral sample.** `LoopLibrary.add` is upgrade-append, so a
   repeated sequence keeps only its BEST rating. Any library-derived median is biased
   upward — measure populations from the episode windows, not the archive.
5. **Workers advance the curriculum independently** and every worker writes `curriculum/*`
   last-write-wins, so a single sample is one arbitrary worker and the fleet can span three
   phases at once. Read spreads and trends, never a point.

### Shape feasibility is a function of the piece budget (Aug-12)

Measured on one policy, 10 unaided episodes per seed, budget the only variable:

| seed | closes @120 pieces | closes @80 |
|---|---|---|
| oval | 90% | 50% |
| out-and-back | 40% | 90% |
| winding | 60% | 70% |

At 120 an oval is easy (long straights fill the length) and a winding loop is hard; at 80 it
**inverts**. This made the agent's monoculture *rational*: under P6's gate an oval was worth
0.90 x 0.625 = 0.56 of the completion payout against 0.40 x 1.00 = 0.40 for the shape it was
asked for, so no reward tuning or extra training could move it. `phase5_target_length` and
`phase6_max_length` were cut 120 -> 90 for this reason (8a89ab7). **Before concluding a
policy "won't" do something, check whether it is already optimal given its abilities.**
Cost, stated honestly: quality keeps improving past 90 (library median E 5.54 at 75-89
pieces, 6.34 at 105-119), so the cut trades ~0.4 of attainable excitement for variety being
possible at all — acceptable only because the criteria ask for E >= 4.5, not maximal E.

### Variety: frequency is the binding term, and a NON-DECAYING value term can move it (Aug-26)

The seed-conditioned campaign asked the agent to build five footprint families. It built
one. The whole arc, because both the failures and the eventual fix are load-bearing --
and because the conclusion was called wrong twice on the way.

**Nine value-side levers were null.** Guidance falloffs, cold-episode fraction,
exploration floor, scaffold at high and low k, piece budget, gate floor, dense weight,
family bonus, family gate. Every one changed what a non-oval build is WORTH while the
attempt rate was ~0.05%, so none was ever collected. The arithmetic that explains them:
a reward for an action taken 0.05% of the time contributes 0.05% of its face value.

**Entropy moves it but cannot hold it.** Measured across five days at a constant Phase 6
on one policy lineage (`harvest_cold`, `prefix_len=0`):

| entropy (nats) | unaided non-oval rate | families |
|---|---|---|
| 0.97 | 0.92% | spiral, out_and_back, winding |
| 0.89 | 0.28% | + serpentine |
| 0.68 | 0.03% | |
| 0.41 | 0.01% | |

A fixed `ent_coef` has an EQUILIBRIUM entropy that falls as the policy converges, so an
entropy floor is a headwind, not a floor: 0.045 held ~0.95 nats for two days then leaked
back to 0.74 with the guard pinned at max boost. Tripling `ent_coef` bought +0.08 nats of
equilibrium; reaching 0.85 from a converged policy would need ~0.2, which destroys it.
You cannot re-inflate a saturated softmax (tried: plateaued at 0.40). Rewinding to a
high-entropy checkpoint restores variety for ~2 days because it restores ENTROPY, not
skill -- the 08-12 12:04 checkpoint had entropy 0.876 AND quality 5.55, quality having
jumped 2.66 -> 5.55 in the preceding six hours, which is exactly when variety died: the
policy found a high-excitement OVAL recipe and collapsed onto it.

**The missing skill is one motor pattern.** Over 6,193 unaided builds `switch_count` was
0 in 6,191 and `turn_count` was 4 in 6,170. Four same-direction 90-degree turns is exactly
the 360 needed to close; eight is a spiral. Both are REPETITION of what the policy already
does, which is why entropy buys spirals and nothing else. Every switch-requiring family
needs a CANCELING TURN PAIR.

**What finally worked: a diversity reward that does not decay** (`R_novelty`, 250 at P6).
Paid at completion as `R_novelty * (1 - frequency of this build's behaviour cell among the
last 200 UNAIDED builds)`, cell from `footprint.descriptor_cell` (the FAMILIES band edges,
so one source of truth, and coarse enough that gaining a SINGLE switch moves cell and pays
before any family matches). While ovals dominate, an oval pays ~0 and anything else pays
near full -- a property of the recent BUILD DISTRIBUTION, not of policy entropy, so
convergence cannot erode it. Measured over 53,130 unaided builds:

| chunk (7,077 builds) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| non-oval rate | 0.057% | 0.028% | 0.071% | 0.099% | 0.127% | 0.170% |

Monotonic, ~6x, still climbing, and it reached THREE families unaided including winding
(`LLRLLLRRLL`, 10 turns / 4 switches / 107 pieces / E 5.96) -- the canceling-turn-pair
skill no other lever ever produced. Non-oval quality median 5.97 vs the 5.63 oval
baseline, though it is bimodal (a second winding rated 1.44), so shape does not imply
quality.

**On-demand verdict (Aug-29 — SUPERSEDED Sep-5, see the seed-conditioning section
above; kept because the reward arithmetic below is still the right diagnosis):** all 20 requested
builds came out OVAL — 4/4 hit for oval, 0/4 for every other family. The seed is in the
observation on every step and changes essentially nothing.

The reward column is the interesting part: ~2,500 when oval is requested and the family
gate is satisfied, ~1,180 when serpentine is requested and it is missed. **The agent
knowingly forfeits ~50% of its payout on every mismatched build and still builds the
oval.** So this is not a conditioning failure -- the policy is making a rational trade we
set up: eating the family penalty beats risking a shape it cannot reliably close. It
follows that MORE penalty is the wrong lever (it trades against completion, which is at
0.99); the shape has to become achievable, not the alternative more painful.

Also: inference is deterministic by default, so repeated builds with the same seed are
byte-identical (episodes 3 and 4 matched exactly in every block). "Generate 10 coasters"
from one checkpoint yields 5 distinct builds repeated, unless `--sample` is passed. Do not
judge a checkpoint's variety from a batch without it.

**RESOLUTION (Sep-4): the diversity reward decays too — through the FREQUENCY door.**
Measured across the full run, entropy fell monotonically the whole time and variety
tracked it down:

| entropy (nats) | 0.71 | 0.65 | 0.62 |
|---|---|---|---|
| unaided non-oval rate | 0.235% | 0.119% | **0.013%** |

The final point is 2 events in 15,002 unaided builds where the earlier rate predicts 18
(P = 0.0003, so this is not noise). The bonus's VALUE never decayed — an oval still pays
~0 and a rare shape still pays ~250, exactly as designed. But the bonus can only be
COLLECTED on a build the policy actually emits, and the emission rate is governed by
entropy, which falls as the policy converges. So the frequency constraint reasserts
itself through the back door.

Two hypotheses were tested and REFUTED on the way, both worth not repeating:
  * "the restart emptied the novelty windows" — windows are 200/worker and refill after
    ~4,000 cold builds; the rate had not recovered by 15,000, and the decline predates
    the restart.
  * "the rate is still climbing" (the Aug-26 reading) — true then, but it peaked at
    0.235% and declined monotonically afterwards.

So the campaign's synthesis is ONE mechanism, not several: everything that has ever moved
variety moved it by raising the ATTEMPT RATE, and everything that raised the attempt rate
was temporary, because a fixed ent_coef's equilibrium entropy falls with convergence. The
diversity reward is still the best lever found (6x rise, three families unaided, the
canceling-turn-pair skill nothing else produced) — it just buys time rather than holding.

**RULE 1:** before adding a reward term, check whether the behaviour it pays for is ever
EMITTED. That explains all nine failures.

**RULE 2 (the correction):** a value term CAN still work if it does not decay, because
every collection reinforces the behaviour that earned it and the rate COMPOUNDS. This was
called dead at 10,169 builds on 5 events and an average payment of 1.2 of 250 -- the
arithmetic was right, the inference was wrong. The same premature call was made twice
more: entropy's climb was called "flat" after 6h while rising +0.136 nats/1M, and
`prime_scale`'s drift was read three different ways in three heartbeats before being
fitted (slope -0.005/1M against 0.036 noise). **On a rate this low, no conclusion is
available below ~5 events per bucket and several buckets. Fit the trend, quote the noise,
and never read a per-heartbeat point as direction.**

### Seed-conditioning DID emerge — once a second behaviour existed (Sep-5)

Measured with `run_model.py --family N --sample`, 20 builds each, on the ~40M checkpoint:

| requested | built | hit |
|---|---|---|
| oval | 19 oval, 1 out_and_back | **95%** |
| out_and_back | 17 out_and_back, 3 oval | **85%** |

Fisher exact on "built out_and_back" (1/20 when oval asked vs 17/20 when out_and_back
asked): **p < 0.00001**. The other three families, 15 builds each, are all 0% — and each
returns a ~50/50 oval/out_and_back split, i.e. the agent's UNCONDITIONED base
distribution. So the seed is not ignored in general; it is ignored specifically for shapes
the policy cannot build. 2 of 5 families on demand, against criterion 2's "4 of 5" —
NOT MET, but from 0 of 5 the day before. On Aug-29 the same test gave 20 requested builds and 20 ovals,
0/4 for every non-oval family, and the conclusion recorded here was that the seed "changes
essentially nothing". That conclusion is now WRONG and superseded.

**Why the nine conditioning levers looked dead.** The family gate, `R_family` bonus and
dense family potential were paying the whole time. They could not express anything while
the policy had exactly ONE shape in its repertoire — there was nothing to select between,
so the seed had no lever to pull. The diversity reward (`R_novelty`) supplied a second
reliable behaviour (out_and_back, 6-9 turns with 1-2 direction switches, reached ~44% of
unaided builds), and conditioning appeared within hours of that behaviour becoming common.

RULE: a conditioning signal cannot be learned before the behaviours it selects among
exist. Check REPERTOIRE before concluding a conditioning mechanism is broken — the levers
may be fine and blocked upstream.

This is also why the campaign's earlier framing ("the agent knowingly forfeits ~50% of its
payout and still builds the oval — so make the shape ACHIEVABLE, not the alternative more
painful") was the right diagnosis: making the shape achievable is exactly what fixed it.

### The warm-start frontier is not a competence proxy (Aug-11)

`warm_k_max` stalled at 8-13 for millions of steps while cold completion sat at 0.72-0.85:
the agent completes a whole loop unaided more reliably than it finishes the last 13 pieces
of someone else's, because a replayed prefix leaves it in states from another coaster's
geometry that are off-distribution for a policy trained on its own trajectories. Two
consequences: `p_cold`'s competence ramp keys on `k_max` and therefore cannot fire; and warm
episodes at low k teach docking, not composition (measured: the agent placed **9.6%** of the
turns and zero turns in 352 of 525 builds). Do not read a stalled frontier as a stalled
policy.

## Important Notes

- The OpenRCT2 game must have the API plugin installed and running (default port 8080)
- Training logs and models are saved to `logs/` and `ppo_openrct2_tensorboard/`
- The environment expects the API server to be running before starting training
- Auto-backtracking helps agents recover from bad decisions during training
